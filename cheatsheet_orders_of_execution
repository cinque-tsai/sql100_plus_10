-- This is a piece of code modified from one Datacamp answer.
--I think it well reflects the sql exectuting oder, which I find challenging to understand.

--Being First doesn't mean to be first into the pipe.
--In fact, select is the second to last executed line
SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
--FROM is the first
FROM films
--Then Where, and it takes only single-row filte
--Wait for Having to do aggregated stuff like sum,avg,max...
WHERE release_year > 1990
--Then Group by
GROUP BY release_year
-- Then Group by's best friend Having. Note that since Having and Where are both ahead of select, the alias won't work 
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
-- Order/limit/offset are last, so feel free to use alias;)
ORDER BY avg_gross AESC
Limit 15;
